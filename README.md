# filemanagment

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

here in this branch, I have added the functionality to read data from a text (comma Delimited) file and write some of it's selected contents to a database.

I have added a sample of the text file along with an Excel file in a directory with the name File Samples
